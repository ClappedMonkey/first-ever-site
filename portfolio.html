						<p> I had a poster fair as part of my university module 'People and Computing'. The poster was about a product me and another group of inviduals had to make with an mBed sensor. 
							I used photoshop to edit and create the poster ad also created aa video along with it to showcase what the sensor will be about. Below you will see the poster I created as well as the link to the video 
							itself.

						<p> One of the first tasks me and my group were set was to make a Logo for our group project. Our group project was
							based on a smartwatch that tells the user the temperature, the world clock and has an inbuilt themometer. <p> The themometer idea was a flop because we found out that if the temperature outside the house was to be warm then the temperature in the house would be cold. So we decided to remove that feature of the project. The logo I created is shown below. If you want a logo created for you just send me an email. 
							</p>
							<p>
							The logo on the left was the final piece where as the logo on the bottom is the first draft. The images are up for download, click the image to download it.
